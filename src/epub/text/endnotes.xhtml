					<p>The old definition of the word social has been a tremendous drag on politics. Social policies are not policies for the good of the people but policies created by the people, <abbr>etc.</abbr> <abbr class="eoc">etc.</abbr> We read in the work of a continental sociologist, “When a social will is born in the brain of a man,” but a social will never is born in the brain of a man. <a href="chapter-1.xhtml#noteref-3" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>This is essentially the process by which sovereignty is created. Therefore chapters <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span>⁠–⁠<span epub:type="z3998:roman">VI</span> on The Group Process are the basis of the conception of sovereignty given in part <span epub:type="z3998:roman">III</span> and of the relation of that conception to the politics of reconstruction. <a href="chapter-1.xhtml#noteref-4" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-5" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>This is the heart of the latest ethical teaching based on the most progressive psychology: between two apparently conflicting courses of action, a and b, a is not to be followed and b suppressed, nor b followed and a suppressed, nor must a compromise between the two be sought, but the process must always be one of integration. Our progress is measured by our ability to proceed from integration to integration. <a href="chapter-2.xhtml#noteref-5" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-6" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>This statement may be misunderstood unless there is borne in mind at the same time: (1) the necessity for the keenest individual thinking as the basis of group thinking, and (2) that every man should maintain his point of view until it has found its place in the group thought, that is, until he has been neither overruled nor absorbed but integrated. <a href="chapter-2.xhtml#noteref-6" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-7" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>We must not of course confuse the type of unifying spoken of here (an integration), which is a psychological process, with the “reconciliation of opposites,” which is a logical process. <a href="chapter-2.xhtml#noteref-7" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>I am sometimes told that mine is a counsel of perfection only to be realized in the millennium, but we cannot take even the first step until we have chosen our path. <a href="chapter-2.xhtml#noteref-8" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>The break in the English Cabinet in 1915, which led to the coalition Cabinet, came when both Kitchener and Churchill tried to substitute individual for group action. <a href="chapter-2.xhtml#noteref-9" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

				</li>
				<li id="note-11" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>It has been overemphasized in two ways: first, many of the writers on imitation ignore the fact that the other law of association, that of interpenetrating, is also in operation in our social life, as well as the fact that it has always been the fundamental law of existence; secondly, they speak as if it were <em>necessary</em> for human beings to be under the law of imitation, not that it is merely a stage in our development. <a href="chapter-3.xhtml#noteref-11" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-12" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>This is the alpha and omega of philosophical teaching: Heraclitus said, “Nature desires eagerly opposites and out of them it completes its harmony, not out of similars.” And James, twenty-four hundred years later, has given his testimony that the process of life is to “compenetrate.” <a href="chapter-3.xhtml#noteref-12" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

				<li id="note-13" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>Also the group-units of early societies are studied to the exclusion of group-units within modern complex society. <a href="chapter-3.xhtml#noteref-13" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-14" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>Even some of our most advanced thinking, which repudiates the like-minded theory and takes pains to prove that imitation is not an instinct, nevertheless falls into some of the errors implicit in the imitation theory. <a href="chapter-3.xhtml#noteref-14" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

				<li id="note-15" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>When we come in part <span epub:type="z3998:roman">III</span> to consider the group process in relation to certain political methods now being proposed, we shall find that part of the present disagreement of opinion is verbal. I therefore give here a list of words which can be used to describe the genuine social process and a list which gives exactly the wrong idea of it. Good words: integrate, interpenetrate, interpermeate, compenetrate, compound, harmonize, correlate, coordinate, interweave, reciprocally relate or adapt or adjust, <abbr class="eoc">etc.</abbr> Bad words: fuse, melt, amalgamate, assimilate, weld, dissolve, absorb, reconcile (if used in Hegelian sense), <abbr class="eoc">etc.</abbr> <a href="chapter-3.xhtml#noteref-15" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-16" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>This does not, however, put us with those biologists who make conscience a “gregarious instinct” and⁠—would seem to be willing to keep it there. This is the insidious herd fallacy which crops up constantly in every kind of place. We may today partake largely of the nature of the herd, our conscience may be to some extent a herd conscience, but such is not the end of man for it is not the true nature of man⁠—man does not find his expression in the herd. <a href="chapter-6.xhtml#noteref-16" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-17" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>To a misunderstanding of this point are due some of the fallacies of the political pluralists (see chapter <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XXXII</span>). <a href="chapter-6.xhtml#noteref-17" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

				</li>
				<li id="note-19" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>This view of purpose is not necessarily antagonistic to the “interest” school of sociology, but we may perhaps look forward to a new and deeper analysis of self-interest. And the view here put forward is not incompatible with the “objective” theory of association (see chapter <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XXIX</span>) nor with the teleological school of jurisprudence (see chapter <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XV</span>), it merely emphasizes another point of view⁠—a point of view which tends to synthesize the “subjective” and “objective” theories of law. But those jurists who say that a group is governed by its purpose and leave the matter there are making a thing-in-itself of the purpose; we are governed by the purpose, yes, but we are all the time evolving the purpose. Modern jurists wish a dynamic theory of law⁠—only such a conception of purpose as is revealed by group psychology will give value to a teleological school of jurisprudence. <a href="chapter-6.xhtml#noteref-19" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-20" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>In a relation even of two I am not faithful to the other person but to my conception of the relation in the whole. Loyalty is always to the group idea not to the group-personnel. This must change our idea of patriotism. <a href="chapter-6.xhtml#noteref-20" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

				<li id="note-22" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>This is the principle of the vote in a democracy (see chapter <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XXI</span>). This must not, however, be confused with the old Hegelianism (see chapter <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XXIX</span> on “Sovereignty”). <a href="chapter-7.xhtml#noteref-22" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-23" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>In art this is what impressionism has meant. In the era before impressionism art was in a static phase, that is, artists were working at fixed relations. The “balance” of modern artists does not suggest fixedness, but relation subject directly to the laws of the whole. <a href="chapter-7.xhtml#noteref-23" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>See chapter <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XXI</span>. I have been told that the distinction between the organic and the psychic theory of society is merely academic. But no one should frame amendments on the initiative and referendum without this distinction; no one without it can judge wisely the various schemes now being proposed for occupational representation⁠—something every one of us will have soon to do. <a href="chapter-10.xhtml#noteref-27" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

				<li id="note-28" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>It must be remembered, however, that these welfare arrangements are often accompanied by truly social motives, and experiments looking towards a more democratic organization of industries. <a href="chapter-11.xhtml#noteref-28" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-29" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>A good example of the crowd fallacy is the syndicalist theory that the vote should be taken in a meeting of strikers not by ballot but by acclamation or show of hands. The idea is that in an open meeting enthusiasm passes from one to another and that, therefore, you can thus get the collective will which you could not get by every man voting one by one. <a href="chapter-12.xhtml#noteref-29" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

				</li>
				<li id="note-31" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>The expressions “mutual aid” and “animal cooperation” have, however, a slightly misleading connotation; mutual adaptation, coordinated activities, come nearer the truth. It is confusing to take the words and phrases we use of men in the conscious stage and transfer them to the world of animals in the unconscious stage. <a href="chapter-13.xhtml#noteref-31" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>We have a number of minor instances of the recognition of the group principle in industry.

					<p>It must be understood that all I say does not apply to all the pluralists. For the sake of brevity I consider them as a school although they differ widely. Moreover, for convenience I am using the word pluralist roughly and in a sense inaccurately to include all those who are advocating a multiple group organization as the basis of a new state. Most of these agree in making the group rather than the individual the unit of politics, in their support of group “rights,” the “consent” of the group, the “balance” of groups, and in their belief that “rights” should be based on function. But syndicalists and guild socialists are not strictly pluralists since they build up a system based on the occupational group; yet the name is not wholly inapplicable, for, since the guild socialists base their state on balancing groups, that state cannot be called a unified state.

We see the corporation long ignored and the idea of legal partnership influencing the development of the social contract theory, which in its turn reacted on legal theory. We find the juristic conception of group personality, clearly seen as early as Althusius (1557⁠–⁠1638), and revived and expanded by Gierke, influencing the whole German school of “group sociologists.” But today are not many of us agreed that however interesting such historical tracing, our present notion of sovereignty must rest on what we learn from group psychology? <a href="chapter-29.xhtml#noteref-119" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Laski is an exception to many writers on “consent.” When he speaks of consent he is referring only to the actual facts of today. Denying the sovereignty postulated by the lawyers (he says you can never find in a community any one will which is certain of obedience), he shows that as a matter of fact the state sovereignty we have now rests on consent. I do not wish to confuse the issue between facts of the present and hopes for the future, but I wish to make a distinction between the “sovereignty” of the present and the sovereignty which I hope we can grow. This distinction is implicit in <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Laski’s book, but it is lacking in much of the writing on the “consent of the governed.” <a href="chapter-31.xhtml#noteref-130" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>Wherever you have the social contract theory in any form, and assent as the foundation of power, there is no social process going on; the state is an arbitrary creation of men.

					<p>Yet perhaps the trade-union has been one of the truest groups, one of the most effective teachers of genuine group lessons which we have yet seen. Increased wages, improved conditions, are always for the group. The trade-unionist feels group-wants; he seeks to satisfy these through group action. Moreover the terms of a collective bargain cannot be enforced without a certain amount of group solidarity. In strikes workmen often sacrifice their own interests for what will benefit the union: the individual⁠—I may prefer his present wages to the privations of a strike; the group-I wants to raise the wages of the whole union. <a href="chapter-33.xhtml#noteref-138" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
